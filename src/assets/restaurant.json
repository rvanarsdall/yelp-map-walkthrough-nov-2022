    "about": "It all began in July of 2016 when we decided to share our love of tacos with the world. A cooler filled with hot bricks wrapped in foil, kept the first batch of breakfast tacos warm as I stood on the side of the road at 7 a.m. anxiously awaiting our first customer. That morning didn’t bring much luck but we didn’t let it stop us. With the support of family I was back out there the next morning and to my surprise we sold out! That’s when Tito’s was born. Fast forward 3 years and with the overwhelming support of our community we have turned this taco dream into a taco reality. To feed the need for our one of a kind tacos & burritos we now operate out of a fully equipped taco trailer in Brattleboro VT and Greenfield MA, along with a commercial kitchen with no plans of stopping there. Our ultimate goal is to expand into brick and mortar locations to better serve our community and encourage all who come in contact with Tito’s to follow their dreams too. "
